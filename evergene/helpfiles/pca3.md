**M.** Download all PCA plots as a PDF file. This will download the scree plots and PCA plots (PC1 vs PC2, PC3 vs PC4... PC9 vs PC10) for each input gene and cancer type.\
**N.** Download all PCA data and plots. This will download the zipped folder, organised into folders with input cancers, and folders with data, scree plots and PCA plots (PC1 vs PC2, PC3 vs PC4... PC9 vs PC10) for each input gene. In addition, there are three .csv files:
- **pca_data.csv**: PC values, gene expression and sample annotation for the selected genes for each cancer type.
- **top_gene_contributions.csv**: Table listing the top 100 genes with the highest % contribution in each PC.
- **variance_contribution.csv**: The % of contribution each input gene has towards each PC.
