# Evergene
A webtool for interactive principal component analysis (PCA), survival analysis and correlation analysis using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project data. Users can input their own data for PCA and correlation analysis. The analysis focuses on multi-gene input/output and integration of sample annotation in data visualisation.

## Getting started
Evergene can be accessed at https://bshihlab.shinyapps.io/evergene/. Users can click on the "Example 1" and "Example 2" buttons on the sidebar to load an example input using TCGA data. Example user input data can be found in the folder "example_user_input" in this GitHub page (data from https://gtexportal.org/).

Detailed helpfiles can be found by clicking on the question marks next to each section. Links to helpfiles are in the links below.\
